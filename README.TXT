- "INSTALL.TXT" shows how to build the software.

- "exeset" directory contains data for simulator such as model data. "MS" 
  directory contains common data also used by real robot.

- "src" directory contains header files, source files and library files. 
  Comments in the header files and the source files are written in Japanese :-(

- Now we are developing a new multi robot simulator, so the development of 
  this software is suspended.
